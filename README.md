PROBLEM STATEMENT There is a huge demand of used cars in the Indian Market today. As sale of new car have slowed down in the recent past, the pre-owned car market has continued to grow over the past year and is larger than the new car market now. Consider this: In 2018-19, while new car sales were recorded at 3.6 million units, around 4 million second-hand cars were bought and sold. There is a slowdown in new car sales and that could mean that the demand is shifting towards the pre-owned market. In fact, some car sellers replace their old cars with pre-owned cars instead of buying new ones.

The goal of the case is as follows:
The one major factor that holds anyone back while buying a used car is the price(target variable).You will be predicting the Price of used cars with the data collected from various sources and distributed across various locations in India.
Compare different models and find out which one is the most suitable in this case in predicting the prices.
